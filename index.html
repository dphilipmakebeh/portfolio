            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                After completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering I gained interest in building
                mobile applications and so I learned about Android Development and worked as an Android Developer for a 
                year. As I built applications for Mobile phones, simultaneously, I researched about Web development and got hooked on the 
                technology. Thereafter, I took courses in Wordpress development. This landed me a job as a Wordpress developer, building
                Web Applications such as ecommerce sites, registration sites and more. After a while, my job wasn't as challenging so I decided to learn something new. 
                Building Web applications with React and NodeJS got fascinating and so I stuck with it. My new job as a Full stack developer
                gave me the opportunity to garner sufficient experience to embark on a new venture as an Entrepreneur. In this light, I built my own Web Application 
                using React for the front-end and NodeJS for the backend. As lead developer in a team of four, for two years, we ran our
                business fulltime. By the end of 2022, I felt overwhelmed by running a business so I decided
                to get back to working on a full time job. Again, I needed a new challenge and so I got professional training in Blockchain development.
                I learned about building a blockchain, building DApps on Ethereum and building DApps on the Internet Computer Protocol.
                The most fascinating technology amongst these was the Internet Computer Protocol because of its innovation and the fact that 
                I did not have to worry about Databases, APIs, Servers and all the hectic work that comes with the backend.
                Currently I build DApps on the ICP blockchain and I am excited about taking on this new journey. 

                Technology aside, I take pleasure in watching movies and reading books. I still think Hidden Colors is the greatest documentary of all times.

                    CAMEROON TELECOMMUNICATIONS<br>
                    2015 - 2016 (1 year)<br>
                    Working as an Android developer was my first job after graduating from the University as a Computer Engineer.
                    My task was to build an application for the company's web portal. The idea of this app was to send messages to 
                    the user's phone rather than making employees login to the company website inorder to read mails.
                    They required that information should reach their personel on phone. Messages, news and more had to be delivered through push
                    notifications. I built the application on Android Studio using Java. Coding in Java was fun because it was my favorite language at the time.
                    I worked with the guidance of senior developers in the company.

                    Cameroon Gallery<br>
                    2017 - 2018 (1 year)<br>
                    <a href="https://cameroongallery.com/">Cameroon Gallery</a> is an ecommerce site on which you can buy African artifacts. I worked there as a
                    Wordpress full stack developer. I built custom Plugins from scratch, designed the front-end application and 
                    wrote the backend code in PHP. I gained experience working in Php, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I was able to 
                    dable between the front-end and the backend comfortably by the end of my contract. We shipped out products from 
                    Cameroon to America because we had buyers from out of Africa who needed their goods delivered quickly. So once 
                    people placed their orders on our site from out of the continent, we would ship them from America.
                    Sellers would come to us to sell their content online. We would register their content in our system,
                    include it in our online and offline store and promote the products on our social media for customers to
                    see.
                    This job enabled me to be dynamic, creative and well versed with Wordpress CMS.

                    2018 - 2020 (2 years)<br>
                    As a full-stack developer, I built Web applications alongside a large team of over thirty developers working from
                    different regions in Cameroon. We were given tasks to build different applications in the Agriculture and Livestock sector.
                    Most of the applications I worked on were internal web applications. They ran on the ministry's servers and they were accessible 
                    only to personnel. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock had multiple projects including Census programs, Food-chain development 
                    programs and much more. These programs required databases and front-end Web Applications that allowed other employees to 
                    carry out on-field census and save the data directly to the database from any region. Remote access was granted to agents on the field.

                    2020 - 2022 (2 years)<br>
                    237 First Music Services is a one-stop music service online. On this platform, artists could upload
                    all their music content including videos, audio and sheet music. Once the music was published on the app, the artist
                    could promote, sell and distribute their content. Also, the app had a gps service that enabled users to find art creation places.
                    Generally, the idea was to create a platform that could provide all the digital services that a musician required.
